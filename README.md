# HPCL MS-Blend-Optimizer

**MS Blend Optimizer** is a web-based tool designed to assist users in optimizing material blending processes. Built with React, the application provides an intuitive interface for selecting input parameters such as materials, blend ratios, constraints, and timestamps, and then outputs an optimal blend configuration using backend calculations.

This tool is particularly useful for industries or academic environments where optimal blending of resources or inputs is essential for maximizing efficiency or minimizing waste.
